# Gemstone IV Dark Maps
A collection of the various graphical maps made for dark mode, bundled and released by Dendum and mirrored here.

To install, please perform the following steps.
* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/elanthia-online/dark-maps/releases/latest) to your computer
* Extract the maps into your existing Lich5\maps-dark directory, ensuring the individual map files are in that directory and not any subdirectory
* Launch Lich5 and ensure that dark mode is enabled in the launcher, or alternatively can enable dark mode via right-click menu of ;map once it is open  

Alternatively you can print out the maps, but be warned it will use a LOT of ink.
